abstract = {Plant growth analysis provides an explanatory, holistic, and integrative approach to interpreting plant form and function. It uses simple primary data such as weights, areas, volumes, and contents of plants or plant components to investigate processes within and involving the whole plant or crops. Originating at the end of the nineteenth century, plant growth analysis first illuminated plant physiology, then agronomy and, most recently, physiological and evolutionary plant ecology. Plant growth analysis addresses often complex data sets by means of powerful comparative analytical tools.}

abstract = {A study was conducted at Perugla, Italy in 1981 to evaluate the importance of intra-specific competition in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and to investigate the consequence of different percentages of inbred seeds on forage yield. Three seed mixtures having ratios of inbred seed to hybrid seed (S1/F1) of 1/9, 3/7, 1/1 were sown, seed by seed, in micro-plots (50 ✕ 30 cm) at a seeding rate of 1600 seeds/m2. Data were collected on establishment, green matter yield per plant of inbred or hybrid origin, dry matter yield per plot at first, second, and third cut, height and number of stems per plant at the third cut, and number of plants alive in the fall season. The results are summarized as follows: 1) yield of S1 plants was much lower than that of F1 in each of the three mixtures; the inbreeding effect was higher than that usually shown in spaced plant trials; 2) since no differences were observed in dry matter yield per plot among mixtures, differences in S1 seed percentage would not seem important to productivity of alfalfa in the 1st year; and 3) no differences were observed in establishment between S1 and F1 seedlings but fall survival percentages of S1 plants were significantly lower than those of F1 in all mixtures. This confirms that selective elimination of S1 plants begins during the seeding year. The selection against S1 plants increases over time and suggests that 1 year after seeding few S1 plants will survive irrespective of their percentage in the initial seed lot.},

abstract = {Core Ideas The probability distribution of plant survival was presented. A new HS-II Mielniczuk lifetime distribution model was presented for the first time. Smith–Bain distribution was the optimal model for willow density of 24,000 plants ha−1. The HS-II Mielniczuk was the optimal model for willow densities of 48,000 and 96,000 ha−1. Plant survival was evaluated in a statistical analysis. The analysis was conducted based on data from a long-term field experiment where five willow (Salix L.) genotypes were grown at four densities (12,000, 24,000, 48,000, and 96,000 ha−1) in a plantation with an annual harvesting cycle. Four exponential power distributions that best fit plant survival data were selected, including an alternative parametric distribution, which is presented for the first time in this study. The developed models supported predictions of the future distribution of willow plants in groups characterized by different planting density, willow cultivars, and clones. At the recommended density of 24,000 plants ha−1, the exponential power distribution proposed by Smith and Bain best fit willow survival time and the plantation’s productive lifespan. The new hyperbolic secant distribution was characterized by the highest explanatory power measured by Akaike information criterion, Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion, and a heavy-tailed distribution. This model was optimal for higher planting densities (48,000 and 96,000 ha−1) with significantly lower plant survival rates.},
